## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment
1. **Notify stakeholders** of scheduled deployment
   - Send notification 24 hours before deployment
   - Include deployment window and expected downtime
   - Provide rollback plan summary

2. **Backup production data**
   - Create full database backup
   - Verify backup integrity
   - Store backup in secure location
   - Document backup location and timestamp

3. **Freeze code changes**
   - No new commits to main branch
   - Code freeze announcement to team
   - Exception process for critical fixes

### Phase 2: Deployment
1. **Deploy to staging environment**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run db:push
   ```

2. **Run smoke tests on staging**
   - Verify health check endpoint
   - Test critical user workflows
   - Check database connectivity
   - Verify API endpoints

3. **Deploy to production**
   ```bash
   docker-compose pull
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Run database migrations** (if needed)
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

5. **Verify deployment**
   - Check health check endpoint: `/health`
   - Verify application is responding
   - Check logs for errors
   - Verify metrics collection

### Phase 3: Post-Deployment
1. **Monitor application**
   - Watch error rates in Sentry
   - Monitor response times in Prometheus
   - Check database performance metrics
   - Monitor server resources (CPU, memory, disk)

2. **Verify critical workflows**
   - Repository analysis
   - Team dashboard
   - Code suggestions
   - File browsing

3. **Communicate completion**
   - Notify stakeholders of successful deployment
   - Update status page
   - Send all-clear notification

## Rollback Plan

### When to Rollback
Rollback immediately if:
- Critical functionality is broken
- Error rate exceeds 5%
- Database corruption detected
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Performance degradation > 50%

### Rollback Procedure
1. **Stop current deployment**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. **Restore previous version**
   ```bash
   git checkout <previous-version-tag>
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Restore database** (if migrations were run)
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   psql $DATABASE_URL < backup.sql
   ```

4. **Verify rollback**
   - Check health endpoint
   - Test critical workflows
   - Monitor error rates

5. **Communicate rollback**
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Document issues encountered
   - Plan remediation
