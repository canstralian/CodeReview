## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- PostgreSQL database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codereview-ai.git
   cd codereview-ai
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/codereview
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   SESSION_SECRET=your_random_session_secret
   REPLIT_DOMAINS=your-domain.repl.co
   REPL_ID=your_repl_id
   ```
   See `.env.example` for a complete list of configuration options.

4. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   # For Replit Agent tables:
   npx tsx scripts/migrate-agent-tables.ts
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

1. Enter a GitHub repository URL in the search bar
2. Click on "Review Code" to analyze the repository for issues
3. Browse the file explorer to view specific files
4. Click on issues to see suggestions on how to fix them
5. Apply fixes directly with the "Apply Fix" button
6. **Use the Replit AI Agent** for deeper analysis:
   - Click "Start AI Session" in the agent panel
   - Ask questions about your code
   - Request refactoring suggestions
   - Perform security scans
   - Get context-aware explanations
