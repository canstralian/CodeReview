## UI Design
- Uses existing Shadcn UI Card components for consistency
- Lucide React icons for visual enhancement:
  - Brain (Mind Mirror)
  - Code (CodeTuneStudio)
  - Cog (MCP Automation)
  - Shield (Security Projects)
  - BarChart (Content Automation)
- Responsive grid layout with gap-6 spacing
- Hover shadow effect on cards
- Color-coded elements using existing Tailwind classes

## Testing Notes
The component is syntactically correct and properly integrated into the Home page. 

**Validation performed:**
- ✅ Component file structure is valid
- ✅ React imports are correct
- ✅ Component export is present
- ✅ Home.tsx correctly imports and uses the component
- ✅ Component uses existing UI library (Shadcn Card)
- ✅ Responsive design implemented

**Pre-existing build issues (not related to this change):**
- Missing Radix UI dependencies in package.json
- TypeScript configuration issues with Vite plugins
- These issues exist in other components as well and are not introduced by this change

## User Experience Flow
1. User lands on home page
2. Sees search bar and empty state message
3. Scrolls down to see "Recent Conversation Highlights" section
4. Can review 5 featured projects with details
5. Call-to-action at bottom encourages engagement

## Future Enhancements
- Add click handlers to make cards interactive
- Link to detailed project pages
- Add animation on scroll
- Make highlights configurable via API/CMS
- Add "Load More" functionality for additional highlights
