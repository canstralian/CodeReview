  - Connection pool metrics
  - Component latency tracking
- Added Kubernetes-compatible endpoints:
  - `/health` - Comprehensive health status
  - `/health/ready` - Readiness probe

**Test Results:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "uptime": 23.596,
  "checks": {
    "api": { "status": "up" },
    "database": { "status": "up", "latency": 0 },
    "redis": { "status": "up", "latency": 0 },
    "queue": { "status": "up" }
  }
}
```

**Files Modified:**
